# BKDTree

BKDTree offers a simple and high performant implementation of a growing only `BKDTree<T>` and a static `KDTree<T>` for C# and .NET. 

A BKDTree and an KDTree allow storing any queying of multidimensional data. Non of these support a method for removing items.

For nearest neighbor queries there are dediated variants like `MetricBKDTree<T>` and `MetricKDTree<T>`. As nearest neighbor queries require to calculate euclidean distance between values `T` must implement `IMetricTreeItem<in T>`.

## Usage
Items of type `T` that shall be stored in a `BKDTree<T>` or a `KDTree<T>` must implement the interface `ITreeItem<T>` with its method `CompareDimensionTo()`.

```Csharp
public interface ITreeItem<in T>
{
    int CompareDimensionTo(T other, int dimension);
}
```

For nearest neighbor queries there are dediated variants `MetricBKDTree<T>` and `MetricKDTree<T>` while `T` must implement `IMetricTreeItem<in T>` to allow calculation of euclidean distance between values.

```Csharp
public interface IMetricTreeItem<in T> : ITreeItem<T>
{
    double GetDimension(int dimension);
}
```
